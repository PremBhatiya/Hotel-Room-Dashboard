# Hotel-Room-Dashboard
Import your hotel room data into Tableau. This can be done by connecting to your data source, such as an Excel spreadsheet or a database.

Create a new dashboard by selecting "New Dashboard" from the "Dashboard" menu in the top menu bar. This will bring up a blank canvas for your dashboard.

Add visualizations to your dashboard by selecting the appropriate chart types from the "Show Me" pane. For example, you may want to use a bar chart to show the number of rooms in each category, a scatter plot to show the room rates for each room type, or a heat map to show room occupancy rates.

Customize your visualizations by selecting them and using the formatting options in the "Format" pane. This can include changing the colors or fonts, adding labels, or adjusting the axis scales.

Add filters to your dashboard to allow users to interact with the data. For example, you may want to include a dropdown menu that allows users to select a specific room category to view the occupancy data for.

Use the "Publish" option in the top menu bar to share your dashboard with others. You can also set up automatic data refreshes to ensure that the dashboard always reflects the most up-to-date information.

Overall, a well-designed Tableau dashboard should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provide actionable insights into your hotel room data. By following the above steps, you should be able to create an effective dashboard that helps you make informed business decisions.
